adj_match on $match_utils.

Ported from `moo.match_utils` by tools/port_to_verbs.py.  The function is carried
verbatim rather than rewritten, so the behaviour is identical by
construction; tools/equivalence.py checks that against the original.

def adj_match(adjectives: List[str], obj: MOOObject) -> bool:
    """
    Check whether all given adjectives appear in *obj*'s name, in order.

    This is used to disambiguate between multiple objects that share the
    same noun.  For example, if a room contains "a big blue ball" and
    "a small red ball", the adjectives ["blue"] would match the first
    but not the second.

    The matching works in two passes:

    **Pass 1 -- Name scanning (fast path)**:
        Each adjective is searched for as a whole word in ``obj.name``,
        in order.  "In order" means each adjective must appear *after*
        the previous one in the name string.  Word boundaries are
        enforced (so "blue" does not match inside "blueberry").

    **Pass 2 -- Property fallback**:
        If name scanning fails, the function checks for an ``adjectives``
        property on the object (a list of strings).  Adjectives are
        matched by prefix against this list, also in order.

    An empty adjective list always matches (returns ``True``).

    Args:
        adjectives (list of str): Adjective tokens from player input,
            in the order they were typed.
        obj (MOOObject): The candidate game object.

    Returns:
        bool: ``True`` if all adjectives match in order, ``False``
        otherwise.

    Examples::

        adj_match(['blue'], obj_named_"a big blue ball")      # True
        adj_match(['big', 'blue'], obj_named_"a big blue ball")  # True
        adj_match(['blue', 'big'], obj_named_"a big blue ball")  # False (wrong order)
